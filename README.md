# Yii2-content

Most of web applications provide a way for users to register, log in or reset
their forgotten passwords. Rather than re-implementing this on each application,
you can use Yii2-user which is a flexible user management module for Yii2 that
handles common tasks such as registration, authentication and password retrieval.
The latest version includes following features:

* Pages amd categories management
* Meta tags
* Blocks management
* Static content caching

> **NOTE:** Module is in initial development. Anything may change at any time.
